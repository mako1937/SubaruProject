The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, popularly referred to as the 
'Evo',[1] is a sports sedan and rally car based on the Lancer 
that was manufactured by Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi Motors 
from 1992 until 2016. There have been ten official versions to 
date, and the designation of each model is most commonly a Roman 
numeral. All generations use two-litre intercooled turbo inline 
four-cylinder engines and all-wheel drive systems.[2]

The Evolution was originally intended only for Japanese markets, 
but demand on the "grey import" market led the Evolution series 
to be offered through Ralliart dealer networks in the United Kingdom 
and in various European markets from around 1998. Mitsubishi decided 
to export the eighth generation Evolution to the United States in 
2003 after witnessing the success Subaru had in that market the 
previous year with the Subaru Impreza WRX.

In 2001, Mitsubishi was forced by the FIA to run in the WRC using WRC 
rules for building a car instead of the Group A class rules, and this 
did not need to follow homologation rules. The Evolution VII was based 
on the larger Lancer Cedia platform and as a result gained more weight 
over the Evolution VI, but Mitsubishi made up for this with multiple 
important chassis tweaks. The biggest change was the addition of an 
active center differential and a more effective limited-slip differential, 
while a front helical limited-slip differential was added. Torque was 
increased again to 385 N⋅m (284 lb⋅ft) with engine tweaks that allowed 
greater airflow, and horsepower officially remained at 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp).

The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, popularly referred to as the 
'Evo',[1] is a sports sedan and rally car based on the Lancer 
that was manufactured by Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi Motors 
from 1992 until 2016. There have been ten official versions to 
date, and the designation of each model is most commonly a Roman 
numeral. All generations use two-litre intercooled turbo inline 
four-cylinder engines and all-wheel drive systems.[2]

The Evolution was originally intended only for Japanese markets, 
but demand on the "grey import" market led the Evolution series 
to be offered through Ralliart dealer networks in the United Kingdom 
and in various European markets from around 1998. Mitsubishi decided 
to export the eighth generation Evolution to the United States in 
2003 after witnessing the success Subaru had in that market the 
previous year with the Subaru Impreza WRX.

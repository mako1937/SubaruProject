Subaru's marketing strategy was implemented when pop culture was yet to embrace LGBTQ 
culture. When in 1997 Ellen Degeneres' characterr came out as gay in the show Ellen, 
Chrysler pulled their ads stating "We don't think it is a smart business decision to be
advertising in an environment that is so polarized," further stating "Then environment
around this is so angry we feel we lose no matter what we do."[1]

By 1996, Subaru ads were appearing not only in mainstream media, but in gay 
publications as well. Reaction from conservatives was considered, but Subaru's public 
stance was their saving grace. They believed that since their own stance was that they
sold cars to "deiverse and well educated" groups of peple, their more conservative 
customers may not be offended by the ads.

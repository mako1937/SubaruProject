What's the big deal about an All Wheel Drive Vehicle?

SYMMETRICAL AWD

Symmetrical AWD, comprising of a longitudinally mounted Horizontally-Opposed SUBARU BOXER engine 
and a symmetrically designed 4WD drivetrain, is the system that Subaru has focused on for the best 
stability, safety and on-road performance. This unique drivetrain has been at the core of Subaru 
development ever since the world's first 4WD passenger car was released more than five decades ago.
The entire drive system, from the longitudinally mounted Horizontally-Opposed Engine to the rear
differential, is mounted in a straight, symmetrical line. The characteristics of the longitudinally
mounted Horizontally-Opposed Engine, which can be positioned low in the vehicle, have been maximized
to bring the center of gravity as low as possible, and towards the center of the vehicle itself. The
extreme performance that this superior weight balance provides works with the outstanding traction 
of 4WD to limit the chassis rolling and pitching, which occur driving around corners or braking, for
maximum stability at all times. The resulting chassis rocks less and ride comfort is increased, making
the journey enjoyable for all passengers. Subaru's Symmetrical AWD comes in a variety of different
systems depending on the vehicle type and the transmission used.

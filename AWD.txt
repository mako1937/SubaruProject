AWD

All-wheel drive is the easier system for most drivers. In AWD vehicles, 
all four wheels are always getting power, though not necessarily in 
equal amounts. Even the most basic AWD systems sense where the traction 
is and automatically adjust torque appropriately. In an AWD vehicle, you 
can go from grippy pavement to slippery snow or dirt without batting an 
eye. The car does all the thinking for you.

With power going to each wheel in just the right amount, handling 
abilities are greatly enhanced. This is why AWD is so common with modern
 sports cars. There are two main downsides to an AWD system. First, cars 
 equipped with AWD are heavier than their 2WD counterparts and thus get 
 worse fuel economy. And because AWD makes use of several integrated 
 electronic and mechanical systems, problems are harder to diagnose and 
 the driver has less control than in a 4×4. But if you don’t plan on 
 upgrading your suspension and conquering the rocky trails of Moab, a 
 car with AWD will be more than fine.

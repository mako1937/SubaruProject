Why did subaru advertise to lesbians?

New appraoch after slow sales in the 1990's:

During the 1990s, Subaru of America's management team encountered a significant 
predicament. Despite the corporation's attempts to rejuvenate its sales by introducing 
its first high-end automobile and employing a fashionable marketing agency to raise 
awareness, the endeavors were unsuccessful. Consequently, a new tactic 
was implemented. Instead of battling with more prominent car companies for the same 
group of white, suburban-dwelling 18-to-35-year-olds[1], the executives decided to 
promote their vehicles to specific segments.

During the 1990s, Subaru became well-known for providing all-wheel drive as a standard 
feature on all its cars. The company's marketing team was tasked with finding customers
who were willing to pay more for this added benefit. As a result of their research, 
four primary consumer groups were identified. These groups were responsible for half 
of Subaru's American sales and consisted of educators, healthcare practitioners, IT 
professionals, and people who were fond of outdoor activities[1].

There was a fifth group: lesbians.

Tim Bennet, the director of advertising, had this to say:

“When we did the research, we found pockets of the country like Northampton, 
Massachusetts, and Portland, Oregon, where the head of the household would be a single 
person—and often a woman,”.[1] After having discussions with these women it was found 
that they were lesbians. Marketers found that lesbian Subaru owners enjoyed the rugged 
sturdy nature of the vehicles for outdoor activities, while maintaining a less flashy 
appearance than trucks or SUVs.
